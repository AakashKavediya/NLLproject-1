    <h1>HAM ETIQUITTE AND ETHICS.</h1>
    
    <div class="base">
    My dear New HAM,<br>Congratulations! You've got your new Amateur Radio license and can't wait to start operating on HF /VHF/ UHF.. However, you're not certain how you want to conduct yourself. After all, there are few if any mandated rules. Most hams have developed good operating practices and etiquette simply by listening to more experienced hams and you will as well. Here are some of my ideas for your consideration.<br>
<br>
Depending on your radio and license you may have to decide on where and how you want to begin operating. If you are using a hand-held transceiver you may begin through a local repeater or direct (simplex) on the VHF and UHF bands.It may seem obvious but you need to know your call sign before you begin. You might also want to review the appropriate phonetics in case someone asks you to clarify your call sign
    </div>

    <div class="rightside">
        (DO and DON'T)<br>
DO<br>
Always be polite regardless of the circumstances. If not, avoid transmitting.
Set a good example especially for short wave listeners (SWL) who may be thinking about becoming a ham.
Be a good listener. It will help you better organize your thoughts before transmitting.
Speak clearly and slowly, especially when giving your call sign to someone you have never worked before.
Make it clear at the end of each transmission which station is expected to transmit next.  Rehearse what you would do if presented with various scenarios
Look for opportunities to "Elmer" newly licensed hams when you hear them on the VHF/HF bands. Welcome them, solicit their questions and give them pointers on good operating practices.
Develop good operating practices. You will be doing your part in helping insure the continuance of our long and proud tradition of self-regulation.
Consider using the Internet to enrich your QSO. Many hams have developed their own comprehensive websites which you can usually find through QRZ.COM.
DO NOT<br>
Act like some sort of Broadcast Radio station. Your fellow Amateurs will most likely not appreciate such a blatant display of personal ego.
Overuse Q-codes and other ham jargon on the phone bands.
Transmit before first determining that the frequency is clear. This includes transmitting within 3Khz of other known QSOs.
Test your transmitter over the air. It is far better to use a dummy load.
Turn up your microphone gain or resort to excessive speech processing in order to be heard. Such practices will most likely result in diminished audio quality and increased likelihood of interference to nearby QSOs.

    <h6> Radio Amateur is...</h6>
Considerate: He never knowingly operates in such a way asto lesson the pleasure of others.
Loyal: He offers loyalty, encouragement and support to other radio amateurs, Local clubs, the affiliated IARU radio society (presently ARSI in India), through which Amateur Radio in his country is represented nationally and internationally.
<br>Progressive: He keeps his station up to date. It is well built and efficient. His operating practice is above reproach.
<br>Friendly: He operates slowly and patiently when requested; offers friendly advice and counsel to the beginner; kind assistance, cooperation and consideration for the benefit of others. These are the marks of the Amateur (HAM) spirits.
<br>Balanced: Radio is a hobby, never interfering the duties owe to the family, job, community etc.,
<br>Patriotic: His station and skills are always ready for the services to the country and community.

The above Radio Amateur's code is adapted from the original amateur's code, written by Paul M. Segal in 1928. 
<br><br>
<h6>To Initiate a Call</h6> 
Press the mike (PTT) button and say "VU3JYT listening." Of course you would use your own call sign. That might be all you need for a response. But if there is no response (which is quite likely) then you might try again but this time say "VU3JYT listening for a call. QRZ?"
You get a response something like "VU3JYT this is VU3JYU in Whitefield returning. My handle is Jegan Back to you. VU3JYU". At this point you want to wait for the repeater's tone to indicate it is okay to proceed
If you have a really good communication receiver like the Sony ICF range of radios, you can actually decode SSB reception. But don't worry, we can actually manage with a normal short wave radio. For listening to an SSB signal you will have to make a (Beat Frequency Oscillator).
3. Press your mike button and respond. At this point the discussion can be whatever you make it. Give your name and location and any other information you wish to Phil and when you are ready say "Over" or "Back to you." It is a good idea and the law to give your call sign frequently so after a longer transmission you would say "VU3JYU this is VU3JYT. Over." The use of the terms "over" or "back to you" are a courtesy that lets the other operating know that you are finished talking and are turning the operation back to him or her.
At the end of the contact you would finally say goodbye or 73 and sign off by saying "VU3JYU, QRU, 73, this is VU3JYT clear..
<br>
Note: The foregoing tips are just the opinion of one ham that is me. As such, they are intended to be nothing more than a "shopping list" of suggested guidelines presented almost entirely from the perspective of a "rag chewer". . In any event, it is hoped that this list may prove somewhat useful especially for new operators. The overriding theme is common sense and courtesy to others. Let's always remember what a privilege it is to operate on the ham bands! This will help avoid doing anything that might impinge on the enjoyment of our hobby for others.73, VU3JYT, Rajan
