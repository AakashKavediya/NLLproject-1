                My dear New HAM,Congratulations! You've got your new Amateur Radio license and can't wait to start operating on HF /VHF/ UHF.. However, you're not certain how you want to conduct yourself. After all, there are few if any mandated rules. Most hams have developed good operating practices and etiquette simply by listening to more experienced hams and you will as well. Here are some of my ideas for your consideration.

                Depending on your radio and license you may have to decide on where and how you want to begin operating. If you are using a hand-held transceiver you may begin through a local repeater or direct (simplex) on the VHF and UHF bands.It may seem obvious but you need to know your call sign before you begin. You might also want to review the appropriate phonetics in case someone asks you to clarify your call sign.
                Considerate:He never knowingly operates in such a way asto lesson the pleasure of others.
Loyal:He offers loyalty, encouragement and support to other radio amateurs, Local clubs, the affiliated IARU radio society (presently ARSI in India), through which Amateur Radio in his country is represented nationally and internationally.
Progressive:He keeps his station up to date. It is well built and efficient. His operating practice is above reproach.
Friendly:He operates slowly and patiently when requested; offers friendly advice and counsel to the beginner; kind assistance, cooperation and consideration for the benefit of others. These are the marks of the Amateur (HAM) spirits.
Balanced:Radio is a hobby, never interfering the duties owe to the family, job, community etc.,
Patriotic:His station and skills are always ready for the services to the country and community.

The above Radio Amateur's code is adapted from the original amateur's code, written by Paul M. Segal in 1928.
